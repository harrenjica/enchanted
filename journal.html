				When In Manila, way back October 1995. Enchanted Kingdom opened its doors to the public. I still remember the excitement I felt when I first 				stepped in the park grounds.  I was with my cousins then, the feeling I felt was just pure bliss. It was incomparable, my heart was filled 				with happiness in an instant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the years, Enchanted Kingdom remains to be the only world class theme park here in the Philippines, nothing even comes close. They 				have continuously improved in terms of rides and attractions that keeps people coming back for more.
			</p>

				The newest attraction i've seen the last time I went to Enchanted Kingdom was the 4D, which now I believe is the 7D. For those who haven't 				visited EK recently, sharing to you the 6 new attractions you should see when you visit Enchanted Kingdom again.

				Fun and breathtaking-2 words to describe this ride that will keep you spinning literally and figuratively. I wouldn't pick this as the best 				ride, but yes! I would probably ride this again the next time I go back to EK!

				<img src="AirRace.png" alt="Air Race" width = "300" height="200" class="img1"/>
				Another fun ride that I would suggest to try is the Air Race. It can rotate either 180 or 360 degrees,  simulating acrobatic exhibition 				flights. And the best part of the ride is when you are left hanging upside down!

While enjoying the view 				of the whole park while the ride ascends... then suddenly drops 76kph 40 meters from the ground! EKstreme Tower ride will leave your heart up 				in the air and your lungs screaming for more!
